PostGRE SQL, Express, React, Node.Js

# Project's Main Folders(BACKEND and FRONTEND)
Backend: an Express "server.js" providing API support for retrieving and 
         submitting data from the backend.

Frontend: a React "app.js" providing a web-based UI.   

## Working with this Code
Starting the Express Server
    - In a command shell(CMD, Terminal, Powershell etc) run the commands:
        -- cd Backend
        -- npm install
        -- npm start
    - Application listening at http://localhost:4000

Starting the React App.js
    - In a command shell(CMD, Terminal, Powershell etc) run the commands:
        -- cd frontend
        -- npm install
        -- npm start
    - Brower should open up to http://localhost:3000
    - React should be running on the default port of 3000
